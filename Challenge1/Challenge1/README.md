## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SVGs
- Responsive design

### What I learned

- How to develop my first project by using all the knowledge I've acquired recently
- Use SVGs and how they work
- Use spread radius value for shadows

### Continued development

- Responsive design. I've managed to replicate the required designs for the asked viewports but I feel like I could have made it display better for other widths.
- Flexbox is still a work in progress and it sometimes doesn't do what I thought it would.
