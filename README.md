# Welcome to my personal project hub

All my personal projects can be found here

I was thinking that one repo per project might be too chaotic...
 
So I wanted to try and group all my projects in one repo and showcase them with Github Pages

The goal of this project is to challenge myself to learn more about Github and create a portfolio hosted by Github Pages

Everyone will be able to follow my progress in learning web development and check my projects here
