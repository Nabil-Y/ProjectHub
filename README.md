# Welcome to my personal project hub

All my personal projects can be found here

I was thinking that one repo per project might be too chaotic...
 
So I wanted to try and group all my projects in one repo and showcase them with Github Pages

One of the goals of this project is to challenge myself because I'm just starting with Github and I don't know a lot

So I want to learn more about Github and create a mini portfolio hosted by Github Pages
